2. Alpine.js is also considered the Tailwind for JavaScript
3. Completed examples for:

   * Todo Application

4. Followed instructions to install Alpine.js in project:
   * From CDN: Add the following script to the end of your <head> section.
      * <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js" defer></script>
    
        Thats it.

   *  For production environments, it's recommended to pin a specific version number in the link to avoid unexpected breakage from newer versions. For example, to use version 2.8.0 (latest): <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.8.0/dist/alpine.min.js" defer></script>

   * From npm: Install the package from npm.
     * npm i alpinejs
   * & include script import 'alpinejs
